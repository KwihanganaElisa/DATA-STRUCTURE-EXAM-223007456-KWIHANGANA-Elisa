## Summary
To sum up, Adapting to growing user bases and data volumes is essential for online learning platforms, and scalable data structures are key to maintaining performance as these platforms expand. Structures like heaps prioritize tasks such as promoting trending courses or urgent notifications, while B-trees efficiently index large datasets for fast retrieval. These scalable systems ensure that platforms can handle increased complexity without sacrificing speed or accuracy, supporting their long-term viability.
